# Auto Complete

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string `s` and a set of all possible query strings, return all
strings in the set that have `s` as a prefix (in alphabetical order).
The query string is given on the first line of the input, followed by all the possible query strings on the subsequent
lines.
